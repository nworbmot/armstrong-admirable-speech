# William Armstrong's Admirable Speech

In 1863 industrialist and inventor [William Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Armstrong,_1st_Baron_Armstrong) gave a wide-ranging speech on the depletion of coal reserves, energy conservation, hydroelectric power, the greenhouse effect and many other topics, which inspired a lively debate across Britain. Much reference is made to the speech, for example, in William Jevons' seminal 1865 treatise [The Coal Question](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/jevons-the-coal-question) ([Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coal_Question)).

Charles Darwin called the speech [admirable](https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/DCP-LETT-4293.xml).

The speech was given on to the 33rd meeting of the [British Association for the Advancement of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Science_Association), held at Newcastle-upon-Tyne in August and September 1863.

A scan of the original text of the speech from the Report of the 33rd Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, held at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, pages li-lxiv, is available on the [internet archive](https://archive.org/details/reportofbritisha64brit/page/n53/mode/2up).
