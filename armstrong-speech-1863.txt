ADDRESS



BY



SIR WILLIAM G. ARMSTRONG, C.B., LL.D., F.R.S., &c.



Gentlemen of the British Association, — I esteem it the greatest honour of

 ray life that I am called upon to assume the office of your President. In that

 capacity, and as representing your body, I may be allowed to advert to the

 gratifying reception which the British Association met with on their former

 visit to this region of mining and manufacturing industry, and, as a member

 of the community which you have again honoured with a visit, I undertake to

 convey to you the assurance of a renewed and hearty welcome. A quarter of

 a century has elapsed since the Association assembled in this town, and in no

 former period of equal duration has so great a progress been made in physical

 Icnowledge. In mechanical science, and especially in those branches of it

 which are concerned in the application of steam power to effect interchange

 between distant communities, the progress made since 1838 has no parallel

 in history. The railway system was then in its infancy, and the great

 problem of transatlantic steam na\-igation had only received its complete

 solution in the preceding year. Since that time railways have extended to

 cveiy continent, and steamships have covered the ocean. These reflections

 claim our attention on this occasion, because the locality in which we hold

 our present meeting is the birthplace of railways, and because the coal-mines

 of this district have contributed more largely than any others to supply the

 motive power by which steam communication by land and water has been

 established on so gigantic a scale.



The histoiy of railways shows what grand results may have their origin in

 small beginnings. When coal was first conveyed in this neighbourhood from

 the pit to the shipping-place on the Tyne, the pack-horse, carrying a burden

 of 3 cwt., was the only mode of transport employed. As soon as roads

 suitable for wheeled carriages were formed, carts were introduced, and this

 first step in mechanical appliance to facilitate transport had the effect of

 increasing the load which the horse was enabled to convey from 3 cwt. to

 1 7 cwt. The next improvement consisted in laying wooden bars or rails for

 the wheels of the carts to run upon, and this was followed by the substitution

 of the four-wheeled wagon for the two-wheeled cart. By this fiu'ther appli-

 cation of mechanical principles the original horseload of 3 cwt. was aug-

 mented to 42 cwt. These were important results, and they were not obtained

 ■without the shipwreck of the fortunes of at least one adventurous man whose

 ideas were in advance of the times in which he lived. We read, in a record

 published in the year 1649, that " one Master Beaumont, a gentleman of

 great ingenuity and rare parts, adventured into the mines of Northumberland

 with his .£30,000, and brought with him many rare engines not then known

 in that shire, and wagons with one horse to carry down coal from the pits to

 the river, but within a few years he consumed all his money and rode home

 upon his light horse." The next step in the progress of railways was the

 attachment of slips of iron to the wooden rails. Then came the iron tram-

way, consisting of cast-iron bars of an angular section : in this arrange-

 ment the upright flange of the bar acted as a guide to keep the wheel on the

 track. The next advance was an important one, and consisted in transferring

 the guiding flange from the rail to the wheel : this improvement enabled

 cast-iron edge rails to be used. Finally, in 1820, after the lapse of about

 200 years from the first employment of wooden bars, wi'ought-iron rails, rolled

 in long lengths, and of suitable section, were made in this neighbourhood,

 and eventually superseded all other forms of railway. Thus, the railway

 system, like all large inventions, has risen to its present importance by a

 series of steps ; and so gradual has been its progress, that Europe finds itself

 committed to a gauge fortuitously determined by the distance between the

 wheels of the carts for which Avooden rails were originally laid down.



Last of all came the locomotive engine, that crowiiing achievement of me-

 chanical science, which enables us to convej^ a load of 200 tons at a cost of fuel

 scarcely exceeding that of the corn and hay which the original pack-horse

 consumed in conveying its load of 3 cwt. an equal distance.



It was chiefly in this locality that the railway system was thus reared

 from earliest infancy to full maturity, and amongst the many names associated

 with its growth, that of George Stephenson stands preeminent.



In thus glancing at the history of railways, we may observe how promptly

 the inventive faculty of man supplies the device which the circumstances of

 the moment require. No sooner is a road formed fit for wheeled carriages to

 pass along, than the cart takes the place of the pack-saddle : no sooner is

 the wooden railway provided tlian the wagon is substituted for the cart : and

 no sooner is an iron railway formed, capable of carrying heavy loads, than

 the locomotive engine is found ready to commence its career. As in the

 vegetable kingdom fit conditions of soil and climate quickly cause the appear-

 ance of suitable plants, so in the intellectual world fitness of time and circum-

 stance promptly calls forth appropriate devices. The seeds of invention exist,

 as it were, in the air, ready to germinate whenever suitable conditions arise,

 and no legislative interference is needed to ensure their growth in proper

 season.



The coal-fields of this district, so intimately connected with the railway

 system, both in its origin and maintenance, will doubtless receive much at-

 tention from the Association at their present meeting.



To persons who contend that all geological phenomena may be attributed

 to causes identical in nature and degree with those now in operation, the

 formation of coal must present peculiar difficulty. The rankness of vegeta-

 tion which must have existed in the carboniferous era, and the uniformity of

 climate which appears to have prevailed almost from the Poles to the Equator,

 woiild seem to implj- a higher temperature of the earth's crust, and an atmo-

 sphere more laden with humidity and carbonic acid than exist in our

 day. But whatever may have been the geological conditions aifecting the

 origin of coal, we may regard the deposits of that mineral as vast magazines

 of power stored up at periods immeasurably distant for our use.



The principle of conservation of force and the relationship now established

 between heat and motion, enable us to trace back the effects which we now

 derive from coal to equivalent agencies exercised at the periods of its forma-

 tion. The philosophical mind of George Stephenson, unaided by theoretical

 knowledge, rightly saw that coal was the embodiment of power originally

 derived from the sun. That small j)eucil of solar radiation which is arrested

 by our planet, and which constitutes less than the 2000-millionth part of the

 total energy sent forth from the sun, must be regarded as the power which




ADDRESS. liii



enabled the plants of the carboniferous period to -svrest the carbon they re-

 quired from the oxygen with which it was combined, and eventually to deposit

 it as the soUd material of coal. In our day, the reunion of that carbon with

 oxygen restores the energy expended in the former process, and thus we

 are enabled to utilize the power originally derived from the luminous centre

 of our planetary system.



But the agency of the sun in originating coal does not stop at this point.

 In every ^period of geological history the waters of the ocean have been lifted

 by the action of the sun and precipitated in rain iipon the earth. This has

 given rise to all those sedimentary actions by which mineral substances have

 been coUeeted at particular locahties, and there deposited in a stratified form

 with a protecting cover to preserve them for future use. The phase of the

 earth's existence suitable for the extensive formation of coal ajjpears to have

 passed away for ever ; but the quantity of that invaluable mineral which has

 been stored up throughout the globe for our benefit is sufficient (if used

 discreetly) to serve the purposes of the human race for many thousands of

 years. In fact, the entire quantity of coal may be considered as practically

 inexhaiistible. Turning, however, to our own particiilar countiy, and con-

 templating the rate at which we are expending those seams of coal which

 yield the best quality of fuel, and can be worked at the least expense, we

 shall find much cause for anxiety. The greatness of England much de-

 pends upon the superiority of her coal in cheapness and quality over that of

 other nations ; but we have akeady di'awn from our choicest mines a far

 larger quantity of coal than has been raised in all other parts of the world

 put together, and the time is not remote when we shall have to encoimter

 the -disadvantages of increased cost of working and diminished value of

 produce.



Estimates have been made at various periods of the time which would bo

 required to produce complete exhaustion of all the accessible coal in the

 British Islands. These estimates are extremely discordant ; but the discre-

 pancies arise, not from any important disagreement as to the available quan-

 tity of coal, but from the enormous difference in the rate of consumption at

 the various dates when the estimates were made, and also from the dift'erent

 views which have been entertained as to the probable increase of consumption

 in future years. The quantity of coal yearly worked from British mines

 has been almost trebled during the last twenty years, and has probably in-

 creased tenfold since the commencement of the present century ; but as this

 increase has taken place pending the introduction of steam navigation and

 railway transit, and luider exceptional conditions of manufacturing develop-

 ment, it would be too much to assume that it will continue to advance with

 equal rapidity. The statistics collected by Mr. Hunt, of the Mining Record

 Office, show that at the end of 18G1 the quantity of coal raised in the

 United Kingdom had reached the enormous total of 8G millions of tons, and

 that the average annual increase of the eight preceding years amoimted to

 2^ millions of tons. Let us inquire, then, what will be the duration of our

 coal-fields if this more moderate rate of increase be maintained.



By combining the known thickness of the various workable seams of coal,

 and computing the area of the surface under which they lie, it is easy to

 arrive at an estimate of the total quantity comprised in our coal-bearing

 strata. Assuming 4000 feet as the greatest depth at which it will ever be

 possible to carry on mining operations, and rejecting all seams of less than

 2 feet in thickness, the entire quantity of available coal existing in these

 Islands has beea calculated to amount to about 80,000 millions of tons.




liV REPORT — 1863.



which, at the j^resent rate of consumption, would be exhausted in 930 years,

 but, with a continued yearly increase of 2| millions of tons, would only

 last 212 years. It is clear that long before complete exhaustion takes place,

 England will have ceased to be a coal-producing country on an extensive

 scale. Other nations, and especially the United States of America, which

 possess coal-fields 37 times more extensive than om-s, will then be work-

 ing more accessible beds at a smaller cost, and will be able to displace the

 English coal from every market. The question is, not how long our coal

 will endure before absolute exhaustion is effected, but how long will those

 particular coal-seams last which yield coal of a quality and at a price to

 enable this country to maintain her present supremacy in manufacturing

 industry. So far as this particular district is concerned, it is generally

 admitted that 200 years will be sufficient to exhaust the principal seams

 eve7i at the present rate of working. If the production should continue

 to increase as it is now doing, the dui'ation of those seams will not reach half

 that period. How the case may stand in other coal-mining disti'icts I

 have not the means of ascertaining ; but as the best and most accessible

 coal will always be worked in preference to any other, I fear the same rapid

 exhaustion of our most valuable seams is everywhere taking place. Were

 we reaping the full advantage of all the coal we bui-nt, no objection could

 be made to the largeness of the quantity, but we are using it wastefuUy and

 extravagantly in all its applications. It is probable that fuUy one-fourth

 of the entire quantity of coal raised from our mines is used in the pro-

 duction of heat for motive power ; but, much as we are in the habit of

 admiring the powers of the steam-engine, our present knowledge of the

 mechanical energy of heat shows that we rcahze in that engine only a small

 part of the thermic effect of the fuel. That a poimd of coal should, in our

 best engines, produce an effect equal to raising a Aveight of a mUliou pounds

 a foot high, is a result which bears the character of the marvellous, and

 seems to defy aU further improvement. Yet the investigations of recent

 years have demonstrated the fact that the mechanical energy resident in a

 pound of coal, and liberated by its combustion, is capable of raising to the

 same height 10 times that weight. But although the power of our most

 economical steam-engines has reached, or perhaps somewhat exceeded, the

 limit of a million pounds raised a foot high per lb. of coal, yet, if we take tlio

 average effect obtained from steam-engines of the various constructions now

 in use, we shall not be justified in assuming it at more than one-third of

 that amount. It follows therefore that the average quantity of coal which

 we expend in realizing a given effect by means of the steam-engine is about

 30 times greater than would be requisite with an absolutely perfect heat-

 engine.



The causes which render the application of heat so uneconomic in the

 steam-engine have been brought to light by the discovery of the dynamical

 theory of heat ; and it now remains for mechanicians, guided by the light

 they have thus received, to devise improved practical methods of converting-

 the heat of combustion into available power.



Engines in which the motive power is excited by the communication of

 heat to fluids already existing in the aeriform condition, as in those of

 Stirling, Ericson, and Siemens, promise to afford results greatly superior to

 those obtained from the steam-engine. They are aU based upon the principle

 of employing fuel to generate sensible heat, to the exclusion of latent heat,

 which is only another name for heat which has taken the form of improfitable

 motion amongst the particles of the fluid to which it is applied. They also.




ADDRESS. IV



embrace what is called the regenerative principle — a term which has, with

 reason, been objected to, as implying a restoration of expended heat. The

 so called " regenerator " is a contrivance for arresting unutilized heat rejected

 by the engine, and causing it to operate in aid and consequent reduction of

 fuel.



It is a common observation that before coal is exhausted some other motive

 agent will be discovered to take its place, and electricity is generally cited as

 the coming power. Electricity, like heat, may be converted into motion, and

 both theory and practice have demonstrated that its mechanical application

 does not involve so much waste of power as takes place in a steam-engine ; but

 whether we use heat or electricity as a motive power, we must equally depend

 upon chemical affinity as the source of supply. The act of uniting to form a

 chemical product liberates an energy which assumes the form of heat or

 electricity, from either of which states it is convertible into mechanical effect.

 In contemplating, therefore, the application of electricity as a motive power,

 we must bear in mind that we shall stiU reqiiire to effect chemical combina-

 tions, and in so doing to consume materials. But where are we to find mate-

 rials so economical for this piu'pose as the coal we derive from the earth and

 the oxygen we obtain from the air ? The latter costs absolutely nothing ;

 and every pound of coal, which in the act of combustion enters into chemical

 combination, renders more than two and a half pounds of oxygen available

 for power. We cannot look to water as a practicable source of oxygen, for

 there it exists in the combined state, requiring expenditure of chemical

 energy for its separation from hydrogen. It is in the atmosphere alone that

 it can be found in that free state in which we reqiiire it, and there does not

 appear to me to be the remotest chance, in an economic point of view, of being

 able to dispense with the oxygen of the air as a source either of thermo-

 dynamic or electrodynamic effect. But to use this oxygen we must consume

 some oxidizable substance, and coal is the cheapest we can procure.



There is another source of motive power to which I am induced to refer,

 as exhibiting a further instance in which solar influence affords the means

 of obtaining mechanical effects from inanimate agents, I aUude to the

 power of water deseendiag from heights to which it has been lifted by

 the evaporative action of the sun. To illustrate Jhe great advantage of

 collecting water for power in elevated situations I may refer to the water-

 works of Greenock, where the collecting-reservoirs are situated at an

 elevation of 512 feet above the river Clyde. The daily yield of these

 reservoirs is said to be nearly 100,000 tons of water, which is derived from

 the rainfall on an area of 5000 acres. The power obtainable from this quantity

 and head of water is equal to that of a steam-engine of about 2000 horse-

 power, and the whole effect might be realized on the margin of the river by

 bringing down the water in a pipe of sufficient capacity, and causing it to

 act as a column on suitable machinery at the foot of the descent. But the

 hydraulic capabilities of the Greenock reservoii'S sink into insignificance when

 compared with those of other localities where the naturally collected waters

 of large areas of surface descend from great elevations in rapid rivers or ver-

 tical falls. Alpine regions abound in falls which, with the aid of artificial

 works to impound the surplus water and equalize the supply, would yield

 thousands of horse-power ; and there is at least one great river in the world

 which in a single plunge developes sufficient power to carry on all the ma-

 nufacturing operations of mankind if concentrated in its neighbourhood.

 Industrial populations have scarcely yet extended to those regions which

 afford this profusion of motive power, but we may anticipate the time




Ivi REPORT— 1863.



when these natural falls will be brought into useful operation. In that day

 the heat of the sun, by raising the water to heights from which to flow in

 these great rapids and cascades, will become tlie means of economizing the

 precious stores of motive power, which the solar energy differently directed

 has accumulated at a remote period of geological history, and which when

 once expended may probably never be replaced.



I have hitherto spoken of coal onty as a source of mechanical power, but

 it is also extensively used for the kindred purpose of relaxing those cohesive

 forces which resist our efforts to give new forms and conditions to solid sub-

 stances. In these applications, which are geiierally of a metallurgical nature,

 the same wasteful expenditure of fuel is everywhere observable. In an ordi-

 narj' furnace employed to fuse or soften any solid substance, it is the excess

 of the heat of combustion over that of the body heated which alone is ren-

 dered available for the purpose intended. The rest of the heat, which in

 many instances constitutes by far the greater proportioia of the whole, is

 allowed to escape uselessly into the chimney. The combustion also in common

 furnaces is so imperfect, that clouds of powdered carbon, in the form of smoke,

 envelope our manufacturing towns, and gases, which ought to be comijletcly

 oxygenized in the fii'e, pass into the air with two-thirds of their heating

 power undeveloped.



Some remedy for this state of things, we may hope, is at hand, in the gas

 regenerative furnaces recently introduced by Mr. Siemens. In these fur-

 naces the rejected heat is arrested by a so-called " regenerator," as in Stirling's

 air-engine, and is communicated to the new fuel before it enters the furnace.

 The fuel, however, is not solid coal, biit gas previously evolved from coal. A

 stream of this gas raised to a high temperature by the rejected heat of com-

 bustion is admitted into the furnace, and there meets a stream of atmospheric

 air also raised to a high temperature by the same agency. In the combina-

 tion which then ensues, the heat evolved by the combustion is superadded

 to the heat previously acquired by the gases. Thus, in addition to the ad-

 vantage of economy, a greater intensity of heat is attained than by the com-

 bustion of unheated fuel. In fact, as the heat evolved in the furnace, or so

 much of it as is not communicatect to the bodies exposed to its action, con-

 tinually returns to augment the eftcct of the new fuel, there appears to be no

 limit to the temperature attainable, excejit the powers of resistance in the

 materials of which the furnace is composed.



With regard to smoke, which is at once a waste and a nuisance, having

 myself taken part with Dr, Eichardson and Mr. Longridge in a series of ex-

 periments made in this neighbourhood in the years 1857-58 for the purpose

 of testing the practioabUity of preventing smoke in the combustion of bitu-

 minous coal in steam-engine boilers, I can state with perfect confidence that,

 so far as the raising of steam is concerned, the production of smoke is unne-

 cessary and inexcusable. The experiments to wliich I refer proved beyond

 a doubt, that by an easy method of firing, combined with a due admission of

 air and a proper aiTangement of firegrate, not involving any complexity, the

 emission of smoke might be perfectly avoided, and that the prevention of

 the smoke increased the economic value of the fuel and the evaporative power

 of the boiler. As a rule, there is moj-e smoke evolved from the fires of steam-

 engines than from any others, and it is in these fii-es that it may be most

 easily prevented. Eut in the furnaces used for most manufacturing opera-

 tions the prevention of smoke is much more difficult, and will probably not

 be effected until a radical change is made in the system of applying fuel for

 such operations.




ADDRESS. Ivii



Not less wasteful and extravagant is our mode of employing coal for

 domestic purposes. It is computed that the consumption of coal in dwelling-

 houses amounts in this coimtry to a ton per head per annum of the entire

 population ; so that upwards of twenty-nine millions of tons are annually

 expended in Groat Britain alone for domestic use. If any one will consider

 that one pound of coal applied to a well-constructed steam-engine boiler eva-

 porates 10 lbs. or one gallon of water, and if he will compare this eifect with

 the insignificant quantity of water which can be boUed off in steam by a

 pound of coal consumed in an ordinary kitchen fire, he wiU be able to appre-

 ciate the enormous waste which takes place by the common method of burn-

 ing coal for culinary purposes. The simplest arrangements to confine the

 heat and concentrate it upon the operation to be performed would sufiice to

 obviate this reprehensible waste. So also in warming houses we consume in

 our open fires about five times as much coal as will produce the same heating

 effect when burnt in a close and j^roperly consti-ucted stove. "Without sacri-

 ficing the luxury of a visible fire, it would be easy, by attending to the prin-

 ciples of radiation and convection, to render available the greater part of the

 heat which is now so improvidently discharged into the chimney. These are

 homely considerations — too much so, perhaps, for an assembly like this ; but I

 trust that an abuse involving a useless expenditure exceeding in amount our

 income-tax, and capable of being rectified by attention to scientific principles,

 may not be deemed unworthy of the notice of some of those whom I have

 the honour of addressing.



The introduction of the Davy lamp was a great event in the history of

 coal-mining, not as eff"ectiug any great diminution of those disastroiis acci-

 dents which stiU devastate every coUiery chstrict, but as a means of enabling

 mines to be worked which, from their greater explosive tendencies, would

 otherwise have been deemed inaccessible. Thus, while the Davy lamp has

 be«n of great benefit both to the public and the proprietors of coal, it has been

 the means of leading the miners into more peiilous workings, and the fre-

 quency of accident by explosion has in consequence not been diminished to

 the extent which was originally expected. The Davy lamp is a beautiful

 application of a scientific principle to effect a practical purpose, and with

 fair treatment its efficiency is indisputable ; but where Davy lamps are en-

 trusted to hundreds of men, and amongst them to many careless and reck-

 less persons, it is impossible to guard entirely against gross negligence

 and its disastrous consequences. In coal-mines where the most perfect

 system of ventilation prevails, and where proper regulations are, as far as

 practicable, enforced in regard to the use &f Davy lamps, deplorable accidents

 do occasionally occur, and it is impossible at present to point out what addi-

 tional precautions would secure immunity from siich calamities. The only

 gleam of amelioration is in the fact that the loss of life in relation to the quan-

 tity of coal worked is on the decrease, from which we may infer that it is also

 on the decrease taken as a percentage on the number of miners employed.



The increase of the earth's temperature as we descend below the siu-face

 is a subject which has been discussed at previous Meetings of the British

 Association. It possesses great scientific interest as affecting the computed

 thickness of the crust which covers the molten mass assiuned to constitute

 the interior portions of the earth, and it is also of great practical importance

 as determining the depth at which it would be possible to pursue the work-

 ing of coal and other minerals. The deepest coal-mine in this district is the

 Monkwearmouth Colliery, which reaches a depth of 1800 feet below the

 surface of the ground, and nearly as much below the level of the sea. The




ivin REPORT — 1863.



observed temperature of the strata at this depth agrees pretty closely with

 what has been ascertained in other localities, and shows that the increase

 takes place at the rate of 1° Fahr. to about 60 feet of depth. Assuming the

 temperature of subterranean fusion to be 3000°, and that the increase of heat

 at greater depths continvies uniform (which, however, is by no means certain),

 the thickness of the film which separates us from the fiery ocean beneath

 wiU be about thirty-four miles — a thickness which may be fairly repre-

 sented by the skin of a peach taken in relation to the body of the fruit which

 it covers. The depth of 4000 feet, which has been assumed as the limit at

 which coal could be worked, would probably be attended by an increase

 of heat exceeding the powers of hixraan endurance. In the Monkwearmouth

 colliery, which is less than half that depth, the temperature of the air in the

 workings is about 84° Fahr., which is considered to be nearly as high as is

 consistent with the great bodily exertion necessary in the operation of mining.

 The computations therefore of the duration of coal would probably require a

 considerable reduction in consequence of too great a depth being assumed as

 practicable.



At the last Meeting of the British Association in this town, the import-

 ance of establishing an office for mining records was brought under the notice

 of the Council by Mr. Sopwith, and measures were taken which resulted in

 the formation of the present Mining Eecords Office. The British Association

 may congratulate itself upon having thus been instrumental in establishing an

 office in which plans of abandoned mines are preserved for the information of

 those who, at a future period, may be disposed to incur the expense of bringing

 those mines again into operation. But more than this is required. Many of

 the inferior seams of coal can be profitably worked only in conjunction with

 those of superior quality, and they will be entirely lost if neglected until the

 choicer beds be exhausted. Although coal is private property, its duration

 is a national question, and Government interference would be justified to

 enforce such modes of working as the national interests demand. - But to

 enable Government to exercise any supervision and control, a complete

 mining survey of all our coal-fields should be made, and full plans, sections,

 and reports lodged at the Mining Records Office for the information of the

 legislature and of the public in general.



• Before cUsmissing the subject of coal, it may be proper to notice the recent

 discovery by Berthelot of a new form of carburctted hydi'ogen possessing

 twice the illimiinating power of ordinary coal-gas. Berthelot succeeded in

 procuring this gas by passing hydrogen between the carbon electrodes of a

 powerfiil battery. Dr. OdHng has since shown that the same gas may be

 prodiiced by mixing carbonic oxide with an equal volume of light carbu-

 rctted hydrogen and exposing the mixture in a porcelain tube to an intense

 heat. Still more recently, Mr. Siemens has detected the same gas in the

 highly heated regenerators of his furnaces, and there is now every reason to

 believe that the new gas will become practically available for iUiuninating-

 purposes. Thus it is that discoveries which in the first instance interest

 the philosopher only almost invariably initiate a rapid series of steps leading

 to results of great practical importance to mankind.



In the course of the preceding observations I have had occasion to speak of

 the Sim as the great source of motive power on our earth, and I must not omit

 to refer to recent discoveries connected with that most glorious body. Of all

 the results which science has produced within the last few years, none has

 been more unexpected than that by which we are enabled to test the materials

 6i which the sim is made, and prove their identity, in part at least, with those




ADDKESS. lix



of our platiet. The spectrum experiments of Bunsen and Kirchhoffhave not

 only shown all this, but they have also corroborated previous conjectures as

 to the luminous envelope of the sun. I have still to advert to Mr. Nasmyth's

 remarkable discovery, that the bright surface of the sun is composed of an

 aggregation of apparently solid forms, shaped like vrillow-leaves or some well-

 known forms of Diatomacese, and interlacing one another in every direction.

 The forms are so regular in size and shape, as to have led to a suggestion

 from one of our profoundest philosophers of their being organisms, possibly

 even partaking of the nature of Ufe, but at all events closely connected

 with the heating and vivifying influences of the sun. These mysterious

 objects, which, since Mr. Nasmyth discovered them, have been seen by other

 observers as weU, are computed to be each not less than 1000 miles in length

 and about 100 miles in breadth. The enormous chasms in the sun's photo-

 sphere, to which we apply the diminutive term "spots," exhibit the extremities

 of these leaf -like bodies pointing inwards, and fringing the sides of the cavern

 far down into the abyss. Sometimes they form a sort of rope or bridge

 across the chasm, and appear to adhere to one another by lateral attraction.

 I can imagine nothing more deserving of the scrutiny of observers than these

 extraordinary forms. The sympathy also which appears to exist between

 forces operating in the sun and magnetic forces belonging to the earth merits

 a continuance of that close attention which it has already received from the

 British Association, and of labours such as General Sabine has with so much

 ability and effect devoted to the elucidation of the subject. I may here notice

 that most remarkable phenomenon which was seen by independent observers

 at two different places on the 1st of September 1859. A sudden outburst of

 light, far exceeding the brightness of the sun's surface, was seen to take place,

 and sweep like a drifting cloud over a portion of the solar face. This was

 attended with magnetic disturbances of unusual intensity and with exhibitions

 of aurora of extraordinary brilliancy. The identical instant at which the

 effusion of light was observed was recorded by an abrupt and strongly

 marked deflection in the self-registering instruments at Kew. The pheno-

 menon as seen was probably only part of what actually took place, for the

 magnetic storm in the midst of which it occurred commenced before and

 continued after the event. If conjecture be allowable in such a case, we may

 suppose that this remarkable event had some connexion with the means by

 which the sun's heat is renovated. It is a reasonable supposition that the

 sun was at that time in the act of receiving a more than usual accession

 of new energy ; and the theory which assigns the maintenance of its

 power to cosmical matter plunging into it with that prodigious Velocity

 which gravitation would impress upon it as it approached to actual contact

 with the solar orb, would afford an explanation of this sudden exhibition of

 intensified light in harmony with the knowledge we have now attained that

 arrested motion is represented by equivalent heat. Telescopic observations

 wdll probably add new facts to guide our judgment on this subject, and,^taken

 in connexion with observations on terrestrial magnetism, may enlarge and

 correct our views respecting the nature of heat, light, and electricity. Much

 as we have yet to learn respecting these agencies, we know sufficient to infer

 that they cannot be transmitted from the sun to the earth except by com-

 munication from particle to particle of intervening matter. Not that I speak

 of particles in the sense of the atomist. Whatever om* views may be of the

 nature of particles, we must conceive them as centres invested with surround-

 ing forces. We have no evidence, either from our senses or otherwise, of those

 centres being occupied by sojid cores of indivisible incompressible mattei:




Ix -REPORT 1863.



essentially distinct from force. Dr. Young has shown that even in so dense

 a body as water, these nuclei, if they exist at all, must be so small in relation

 to the intervening spaces, that a hundi-ed men distributed at equal distances

 over the vrhole surface of England would represent their relative magnitude

 and distance. What then must be these relative dimensions in highly rarefied

 matter ? But why encumber our conceptions of material forces by this unneces-

 sary imagining of a central molecule ? If we retain the forces and reject the

 molecule, we shall still have every property we can recognize in matter by

 the use of our senses or by the aid of our reason. Viewed in this light, matter

 is not merely a thing subject to force, but is itself composed and constituted

 of force.



The dynamical theory of heat is probably the most important discovery of the

 jjresent century. We now know that each Fahrenheit degree of temperature

 in a pound of water is equivalent to a weight of 772 lbs. lifted 1 foot high,

 and that these amounts of heat and power are reciprocally convertible into

 one another. This theory of heat, with its numerical computation, is chiclly

 due to the labours of Mayer and Joule, though many other names, including

 those of Thomson and Kankine, are deservedly associated with its develop-

 ment. I speak of this discovery as one of the present age because it has

 been established in our time; but if we search back for earlier concep-

 tions of the identity of heat and motion, we shall find (as we always do in

 such cases) that similar ideas have been held before, though in a clouded and

 undemonstrated form. In the writiags of Lord Bacon we find it stated

 that heat is to be regarded as motion and nothing else. In dilating upon

 this subject, that extraordinary man shows that he had grasped the true

 theory of heat to the utmost extent that was compatible -with the state of

 knowledge existing in his time. Even Ai-istotle seems to have entertained

 the idea that motion was to be considered as the foundation not only of heat,

 but of all manifestations of matter ; and, for aught we know, still earlier

 thinkers may have held similar views.



The science of gunnery, to which I shall make but slight allusion on this

 occasion, is intimately connected with the dynamical theory of heat. When

 gunpowder is exploded in a cannon, the immediate effect of the affinities by

 which the materials of the powder are caused to enter into new combinations,

 is to liberate a force which first appears as heat, and then takes the form of

 mechanical power communicated in part to the shot and in part to the pro-

 ducts of explosion which are also propelled from the gun. The mechanical

 force of the shot is reconverted into heat when the motion is arrested by

 striking an object, and this heat is divided between the shot and the object

 struck, in the proportion of the work done or damage inflicted upon each.

 These considerations recently led me, in conjunction with my friend Captain

 Noble, to determuie experimentally, by the heat elicited in the shot, the loss

 of effect due to its ciiishing when fired against iron plates. Joule's law, and

 the known velocity of the shot, enabled us to compute the number of dyna-

 mical units of heat representing the whole mechanical power in the projectile,

 and by ascertaining the number of vmits developed in it by impact, we arrived

 at the power which took effect upon the shot instead of the plate. These ex-

 periments showed an enormous absorption of power to be caused by the

 yielding nature of the materials of which projectiles are usually formed ; but

 further experiments are required to complete the inquiry.



Whilst speaking of the subject of gunnery, I must pay a passing tribute of

 praise to that beautiful instrument invented and perfected by Major Navez of

 the Belgian Artillery, for determining, by means of electro-magnetism, the

velocity of projectiles. This instrument has been of great value in recent

 investigations, and there are questions affecting projectiles which we can

 only hope to solve by its assistance. Experiments are still required to clear

 up several apparently anomalous effects in gunnery, and to determine the con-

 ditions most conducive to efficiency both as regards attack and defence. It is

 gratifying to see our Government acting in accordance with the enlightened

 principles of the age by carrying on scientific experiments to arrive at know-

 ledge, which, in the arts of war as well as in those of peace, is proverbially

 recognized as the true source of human power.



Professor TyndaU's recent discoveries respecting the absoqition and radi-

 ation of heat by vapoui-s and permanent gases constitute important additions

 to our knowledge. The extreme delicacy of his experiments and the remark-

 able distinctness of their results render them beautiful examples of physical

 research. They are of great value as affording further illustrations of the

 vibratory actions in matter which constitute heat ; but it is in connexion with

 the science of meteorology that they chiefly command our attention. From

 these experiments we learn that the minute quantity of water suspended as

 invisible vapour in the atmosphere acts as a warm clothing to the earth. The

 efficacy of this vapour in arresting heat is, in comparison with that of air,

 perfectly astounding. Although the atmosphere contains on an average

 but one particle of aqueous vapour to 200 of air, yet that single par-

 ticle absorbs 80 times as much heat as the collective 200 particles of air.

 Eemove, says Professor Tyndall, for a single summer night, the aqueous

 vapour from the air which overspreads this countiy, and you would assuredly

 destroy every plant incapable of bearing extreme cold. The warmth of our

 fields and gardens would pour itself unrequited into space, and the sun would

 rise upon an island held fast in the grip of frost. Many meteorological phe-

 nomena receive a feasible explanation from these investigations, which are

 probably destined to throw further light upon the functions of our atmosphere.



Pew sciences have more practical value than meteorology, and there are

 few of which we as yet know so little. Nothing would contribute more to

 the saving of life and property, and to augmenting the general wealth of the

 world, than the ability to foresee with certainty impending changes of the

 weather. At present our means of doing so are exceedingly imperfect, but,

 such as they are, they have been employed with considerable effect by

 Admiral FitzEoy in warning mariners of the probable approach of storms.

 "We may hope that so good an object wiU be effected with more unvarying

 success when we attain a better knowledge of the causes by which wind and

 rain, heat and cold are determined. The balloon explorations conducted

 with so much intrepidity by Mr. Glaisher, under the auspices of the British

 Association, may perhaps in some degree assist in enlightening us upon

 these important subjects. We have learnt from Mr. Glaisher s observations

 that the decrease of temperature with elevation does not follow the law pre-

 viously assumed of 1° in 300 feet, and that in fact it follows no definite law

 at aU. Mr, Glaisher appears also to have ascertained the interesting fact

 that rain is only precipitated when cloud exists in a double layer. Rain-

 drops, he has found, diminish in size with elevation, merging into wet mist

 and ultimately into dry fog. Mr. Glaisher met with snow for a mile in

 thickness below rain, which is at variance with our preconceived^ ideas. He

 has also rendered good service by testing the efficiency of various instriiments

 at heights which cannot be visited without personal danger.



The facility now given to the transmission of intelligence and the inter-

 change of thought is one of the most remarkable features of the present

age. Cheap and rapid postage to all parts of the world — paper and printing

 reduced to the lowest possible cost — electric telegraphs between nation and

 nation, town and town, and now even (thanks to the beautiful inventions of

 Professor Wheatstone) between house and house — aU contribute to aid that

 commerce of ideas by which wealth and knowledge are augmented. But

 while so much facility is given to mental communication by new measures

 and new inventions, the fundamental art of expressing thought by written

 symbols remains as imperfect now as it has been for centuries past. It seems

 strange that while we actually possess a system of shorthand by which words

 can be recorded as rapidly as they can be spoken, we should persist in writing

 a slow and laborious longhand. It is intelligible that grown-up persons who

 have acquired the present conventional art of writing should be reluctant to

 incur the labour of mastering a better system ; but there can be no reason why

 the rising generation should not be instructed in a method of writing more in

 accordance with the activity of mind which now prevails. Even without

 going so far as to adopt for ordinary use a complete system of stenography,

 which it is not easy to acquire, we might greatly abridge the time and laboui'

 of writing by the recognition of a few simple signs to express the syllables

 which are of most frequent occurrence in our language. Our words are in a

 great measure made up of such syllables as com, con, tion, iwj, able, ain, ent,

 'est, mice, &c. These we are now obliged to write out over and over again, as

 if time and laboiu" expended in what may be termed visual speech were of no

 importance. Neither has our written character the advantage of distinctness

 to recommend it : it is only necessary to write such a word as " minimum "

 or " ammunition " to become aware of the want of sufficient difference be-

 tween the letters we employ. I refrain firom enlarging on this subject,

 because I conceive that it belongs to social more than to physical science,

 although the boundary which separates the two is sufficiently indistinct to

 permit of my aUuding to it in the hope of procuring for it the attention

 which its importance deserves.



Another subject of a social character which demands our consideration is

 the much-debated question of weights and measures. Whatever difference of

 opinion there may be as to the comparative merits of decimal and duodecimal

 division, there can, at aU events, be none as to the importance of assimilating

 the systems of measurement in different countries. Science suffers by the

 want of uniformity, because valuable observations made in one country are in

 a great measuj'e lost to another from the labour required to convert a series

 of quantities into new denomiuations. International commerce is also im-

 peded by the same cause, which is productive of constant inconvenience and

 frequent mistake. It is much to be regretted that two standards of measure

 so nearly alike as the English yard and the French metre should not be made

 absolutely identical. The metric system has already been adopted by other

 nations besides France, and is the only one which has any chance of becoming

 universal. We in England, therefore, have no alternative but to conform

 with France, if we desire general uniformity. The change might easily be

 introduced in scientific literature, and in that case it wo^^ld probably

 extend itself by degrees amongst the commercial classes without much

 legislative pressure. Besides the advantage which would thus be gained

 in regai'd to uniformity, I am convinced that the adoption of the decimal

 division of the French scale would be attended with great convenience,

 both in science and commerce. I can speak fi-om personal experience of

 the superiority of decimal measurement in all cases where accuracy is re-

 quired in mechanical construction. In the Elswick Works, as well as in

some other large establishments of the same description, the inch is adopted

 as the unit, and all fractional parts are expressed in decimals. No difficulty

 has been experienced in habituating the workmen to the use of this method,

 and it has greatly contributed to precision of workmanship. The iuch, how-

 ever, is too small a unit, and it would be advantageous to substitute the metre

 if general concurrence could be obtained. As to oui- thermometric scale, it

 was originally founded in error; it is also most inconvenient in division,

 and ought at once to be abandoned in favour of the Centigrade scale. The

 recognition of the metric system and of the Centigrade scale by the numerous

 men of science composing the British Association, would be a most important

 step towards effecting that universal adoption of the French standards in this

 country which sooner or later wiU inevitably take place ; and the Association

 in its collective capacity might take the lead in this good work, by excluding

 in futoi-e all other standards from their published proceedings.



The recent discovery of the source of the Nile by Captains Speke and

 Grant has solved a problem in geography which has been a subject of specu-

 lation from the earliest ages. It is an honour to England that this interest-

 ing discovery has been made by two of her sons, and the British Association,

 which is accustomed to value every addition to knowledge for its own sake,

 whether or not it be attended with any immediate utility, will at once appre-

 ciate the importance of the discovery and the corn-age and devotion by which

 it has been accomplished. The Royal Geographical Society, under the able

 presidency of Sir Roderick Murchison, was chiefly instrumental in prociiring

 the organization of the expedition which has resulted in this great achieve-

 ment, and the success of the Society's labours in connexion with this and

 other cases of African exploration shows how much good may be effected by

 associations for the promotion of scientific objects.



The science of organic life has of late years been making great and rapid

 strides, and it is gratifying to observe that researches both in zoology and

 botany are characterized in the present day by great accuracy and elaboration.

 Investigations patiently conducted upon true inductive principles cannot fail

 eventually to elicit the hidden laws which govern the animated world. _ Neither

 is there any lack of bold speculation contemporaneously with this painstaking

 spirit of inquiiy. The remarkable work of Mr. Darwin promulgating the

 doctrine of natural selection has produced a profound sensation. The novelty

 of this ingenious theory, the eminence of its author, and his masterly treat-

 ment of the subject have perhaps combined to excite more enthusiasm in its

 favour than is consistent with that dispassionate spirit which it is so necessary

 to preserve in the pui-suit of truth. Mr. Darwin's views have not passed

 unchallenged, and the arguments both for and against have been urged with

 great vigour by the supporters and opponents of the theory. Where good

 reasons can be shown on both sides of a question, the truth is generally to be

 found between the two extremes. In the present instance we may without

 difficulty suppose it to have been part of the great scheme of creation that

 natiu-al selection should be permitted to determine variations amounting even

 ta specific differences where those differences were matters of degi-ee ; but

 when natm-al selection is adduced as a cause adequate to explain the produc-

 tion of a new organ not provided for in original creation, the hypothesis must

 appear, to common apprehensions, to be pushed beyond the limits of reasonable

 conjecture. The Darwinian theory, when fully enunciated, founds the pedi-

 gree of living nature upon the most elementary form of vitalized matter. One

 step further would carry us back, vdthout greater violence to probability, to in-

 organic rudiments, and then we should be called upon to recogniae in ourselves.

and in the exquisite elaborations of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, the

 ultimate results of mere material forces left free to follow their own unguided

 tendencies. Siu-ely our minds would in that case be more oppressed with a

 sense of the miraculous than they now are in attributing the wondi'ous things

The evidences bearing upon the antiquity of man have been recently pro-

 duced in a collected and most logicaU^^-treated form by Sir Charles Lyell. It

 seems no longer possible to doubt that the human race has existed on the

 earth in a barbarian state for a period far exceeding the limit of historical

 record ; but notwithstanding this great antiquity, the proofs still remain un-

 altered that man is the latest as well as the noblest work of God.



I will not run the risk of wearying this assembly by extending my remarks

 to other branches of science. In conclusion I will express a hope that when

 the time again comes round to receive the British Association in this town, its

 members wiU find the intei-val to have been as fruitful as the corresponding

 period on which we now look back. The tendency of progress is to quicken

 progress, because every acquisition in science is so much vantage ground for

 fresh attainment. We may expect, therefore, to increase our speed as we

 struggle forward ; but however high wo climb in the pursuit of knowledge we

 shall still see heights above us, and the more we extend our view, the more

 conscious we shall be of the immensity which Hes beyond.
